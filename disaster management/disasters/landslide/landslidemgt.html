<h1><b><em>Causes of Landslide</em></b></h1>
<p id="f">While landslides are considered naturally occurring disasters, human-induced changes in the environment have recently caused their upsurge. Although the causes of landslides are wide ranging, they have 2 aspects in common; they are driven by forces of gravity and result from failure of soil and rock materials that constitute the hill slope.</p><br><br>
<p>The causes of landslides are  as mentioned below:<br></p>
<p><u><b><i><br>1.Climate</u></b></i><br>
Long-term climatic changes can significantly impact soil stability. A general reduction in precipitation leads to lowering of water table and reduction in overall weight of soil mass, reduced solution of materials and less powerful freeze-thaw activity. A significant upsurge in precipitation or ground saturation would dramatically increase the level of ground water. When sloped areas are completely saturated with water, landslides can occur. If there is absence of mechanical root support, the soils start to run off.<br>

<u><b><i><br>2.Earthquakes</u></b></i><br>
Seismic activities have, for a long time, contributed to landslides across the globe. Any moment tectonic plates move, the soil covering them also moves along. When earthquakes strike areas with steep slopes, on numerous occasion, the soil slips leading to landslides. In addition, ashen debris flows instigated by earthquakes could also cause mass soil movement.<br>

<u><b><i><br>3.Weathering</u></b></i><br>
Weathering is the natural procedure of rock deterioration that leads to weak, landslide-susceptive materials. Weathering is brought about by the chemical action of water, air, plants and bacteria. When the rocks are weak enough, they slip away causing landslides.<br>

<u><b><i><br>4.Erosion</u></b></i><br>
Erosion caused by sporadic running water such as streams, rivers, wind, currents, ice and waves wipes out latent and lateral slope support enabling landslides to occur easily.<br>
</u></b></i><br>
<u><b><i><br>5.Volcanoes</u></b></i><br>
Volcanic eruptions can trigger landslides. If an eruption occurs in a wet condition, the soil will start to move downhill instigating a landslide. Stratovolcano is a typical example of volcano responsible for most landslides across the globe.<br>.

<u><b><i><br>6.Forest fires</u></b></i><br>
Forest fires instigate soil erosion and bring about floods, which might lead to landslides</u></b></i><br>

<u><b><i><br>7.Gravity</u></b></i><br>
Steeper slopes coupled with gravitational force can trigger a massive landslide.
<br>
<b><br>Human causes of landslides</b></i><br>
<u><b><i><br>1.Mining</u></b></i><br>
Mining activities that utilize blasting techniques contribute mightily to landslides. Vibrations emanating from the blasts can weaken soils in other areas susceptible to landslides. The weakening of soil means a landslide can occur anytime.<br>

<u><b><i><br>2.Clear cutting</u></b></i><br>
Clear cutting is a technique of timber harvesting that eliminates all old trees from the area. This technique is dangerous since it decimates the existing mechanical root structure of the area.</b></p><br>
<br><h2><b><em>preventive measures</em></b></h2><br>
<p>The preventive measures from landslide are as mentioned below:<br>
<br><u><i><b>1.Slope Vegetation</u></i></b><br>
One of the quickest and easiest ways to prevent a landslide on a slope is to vegetate it. This landslide prevention method works best on slopes that are not too steep or if the movement hasn't already begun. You can do this method yourself by planting a groundcover or hire a landscaper to vegetate the slope.<br>

<br><u><i><b>2.Retaining Walls</u></i></b><br>
A solid, well-designed retaining should be made of sturdy materials such as masonry, brick, stone or steel. Drainage materials behind the wall help increase the stability of the wall.<br>

<br><u><i><b>3.Diverting Debri Pathways</b></i></u><br>
Building pathways to divert debris is another option to prevent landslides on your property. You can create these pathways with the help of retaining walls. However, if you build walls to divert debris flow and then that flow lands on a neighbor's property, you can be liable for damage.<br>

<br><u><i><b>4.Temporary Prevention</u></i></b><br>
For temporary landslide prevention, sandbags can be used to divert water from uncontrolled spilling just as retaining walls or diverted pathways do. Another method is to protect unstable areas with plastic sheeting, tarps or even burlap, especially in areas without vegetation because of recent fires.<br></p>
